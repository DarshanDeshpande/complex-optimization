<h2>Complex variable optimization with Tensorflow</h2>

This repository contains code examples for complex variable optimization with Tensorflow. This is accompanied by my series of articles on Complex variable optimization and complex-valued neural nets on <a href="wandb.ai">Weights and Biases</a>

You can find the W&B runs and reports for the above notebooks <a href="https://wandb.ai/darshandeshpande/complex-optimization">here</a>
